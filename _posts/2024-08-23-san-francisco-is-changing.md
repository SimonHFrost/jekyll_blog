Oh San Francisco! The city where driverless cars zoom past streets lined with tech billboards and homeless people sleeping standing up.

I felt oddly at home in San Francisco as I stopped over for a few days on my way back to New Zealand from Mexico. Locals, event attendees, service staff, and tour guides communicated in a quirky analytical style that anyone working in tech is familiar with.

## A changing demographic

San Francisco is one of the biggest tech cities in the world and was affected dramatically by the explosion in remote work. Many tech workers are moving out of the city, keeping their… generous salaries and slashing their rent. SFChronicle reports a 21% decrease in 25-29 year olds after COVID [[Source]](https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/san-francisco-population-data-18140254.php), and you feel it. Wandering around that must have been packed, but now just empty streets.

With the end of the ZIRP (Zero Interest Rate Phenomenon) and thousands of layoffs since 2022. SF wasn’t exempted. [layoffs.fyi](https://layoffs.fy) reports 200k positions eliminated in 2022 alone. This was a second nail in the coffin.

San Francisco currently has an office vacancy rate of 37% [[Source]](https://www.axios.com/local/san-francisco/2024/07/10/office-vacancy-rate-economic-recovery) and you can feel it. Both by the streets and coworking spaces being emptier. Areas with big offices and coworking spaces are quiet, and Twitter (X) left.

Despite office areas being dead, home grown locations like the mission were humming with live music, people with macbooks hacking in cafes, and packed local restaurants.

San Francisco is in the process of reinventing itself.

## Cerebral Valley

Silicon Valley is an outdated term, the Valley famous for tech giants hasn’t been known for hardware for a while now, and is dominated by software companies. Some have now started calling it the ‘Cerebral Valley’

Despite the downtick in people being there, there was a pleasantly surprising amount of events going on where I had to choose from different events each night.

The meetups were professional with multiple staff facilitating and the free pizza and drinks were flowing
Intense recording setup for meetup.

There were a wide range of events, but the ones that were AI focused were definitely the most popular and engaged, with a demographic of people all over the world, which is what SF feels all about.

## Conclusion

San Francisco demographics and focus have changed a lot since COVID and the end of ZIRP due to many people leaving the city.

There’s less buzz in the city, but if you look in the right places there’s still plenty of motivated people with their heads down focusing on the right stuff, especially around AI.

It’s exciting being a part of it.
