Oh San Francisco! The city where driverless cars zoom past streets lined with tech billboards and homeless people sleeping standing up.

I felt oddly at home in San Francisco as I stopped over for a few days on my way back to New Zealand from Mexico. Locals, event attendees, service staff, and tour guides communicated in a quirky analytical style that anyone working in tech is familiar with.

## A changing demographic

San Francisco is one of the biggest tech cities in the world and was affected dramatically by the explosion in remote work after COVID. Many tech workers have moved out of the city, keeping their… generous salaries and slashing their rent. SFChronicle reports a 21% decrease in 25-29 year olds after COVID [[Source]](https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/san-francisco-population-data-18140254.php) and you feel it. From the half empty coworking spaces to empty corporate area streets.

The second nail in the coffin was the end of the ZIRP (Zero Interest Rate Phenomenon) and thousands of layoffs. San Francisco wasn’t exempted with [layoffs.fyi](https://layoffs.fyi) reporting 200,000 positions eliminated in the San Francisco/Bay Area from 2022. Yes, two hundred thousand!

Twitter (x.com) as well as other prominenant tech companies have also left the area [[Source]](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/article/2024/aug/05/x-twitter-san-francisco-office-closing). Twitter (x.com) was a key company lured into the area by tax breaks, and is a huge blow to the area.

Even with an office vacancy rate of 37% [[Source]](https://www.axios.com/local/san-francisco/2024/07/10/office-vacancy-rate-economic-recovery). Less corporate locations like the mission district were full of macbook workers tapping away at their macbooks, streets full with live music, and lines running out of restaurants.

San Francisco is in the process of reinventing itself.

## Cerebral Valley

Silicon Valley is an outdated name. It's been a long time since the 70s and the invention of the silicon microprocessing chip, with recent startups being more known for their software. But as of today, I would even say the software narrative is outdated, with many artificial intelligence startups moving into what they now call the ‘Cerebral Valley’.

Despite the downtick in people being there, there was a pleasantly surprising amount of events going on where I had to choose from different events each night.

The meetups were professional with multiple staff facilitating and the free pizza and drinks were flowing

There were a wide range of events, but the ones that were AI focused were definitely the most popular and engaged, with a demographic of people all over the world, which is what SF feels all about.

If you're visiting San Francisco soon, I would highly recommend checking out [CerebralValley.ai](https://cerebralvalley.ai/) for events.

## Conclusion

San Francisco has changed a lot due to the fleeing of techies. There’s less buzz in the city, but if you look in the right places there’s still plenty of motivated people with their heads down focusing on the right stuff, especially around artificial intelligence.

Digital work is currently going through a huge shift and is starting to raise questions about the relationship of how physical spaces relate to what we do online. As someone who is hugely into communities and physical spaces, I can't wait to see how it will transform.
