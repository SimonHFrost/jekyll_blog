Being optimistic helps you achieve more, be more fun, and… less sad. Here are three thoughts on optimism that... might change the way you look at things.

## Manifesting isn’t just for hippies

Actively thinking about succeeding at something will make it more likely to happen, you can’t find it if you’re not looking for it. It forces you to face unknowns, and make a plan for recovery instead of pretending it won’t happen. Your subconscious is more powerful than you think, so use it to your advantage.

## Humans of the internet-age are scared

We’re in a unique time period where you can instantly communicate to anyone in the world. News travels fast, but negative news travels faster because through natural evolution we’re trained to pay attention to danger for survival. Social media knows this, and profits from it by showing intentionally controversial content. Acknowledging that you’re hardwired to perceive negativity more, means you’re investing in yourself and can start resetting the balance in your favour.

## Start young

Finance knows that high riskier investments are recommended over long time periods, if it dips you have longer time to recover. Taking risks at a younger age means you have more attempts to make things stick. This is doubly so with privilege! Acknowledge any privilege you might have, and take the risk.

## Conclusion

Hopefully I managed to convince you to be a little more optimistic. The book ​Factfulness breaks down why the world is progressing a lot faster than we think, and has been a big influence on me being more optimistic. I would highly recommend it to anyone.
