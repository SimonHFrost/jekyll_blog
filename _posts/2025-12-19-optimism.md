Optimism isn't naive, it's strategic. Here are three reasons why choosing optimism is a rational decision, not wishful thinking.

## Manifesting isn’t just for hippies

Actively thinking about succeeding will make goals more likely to happen, you can’t find something if you’re not looking for it. It also forces you to face unknowns, and make a plan for recovery instead of pretending it won’t happen. Your subconscious is more powerful than you think, so put it to work.

## Humans of the internet age are scared

Humans can now instantly communicate to anyone in the world. News travels fast, but negative news travels faster since we're trained to pay attention to danger for survival. Social media knows this, and profits from it by showing intentionally controversial content. Acknowledging that you’re hardwired to perceive negativity more, means you’re investing in yourself and can start resetting your perception in your favour.

## It's better to start young

In the finance world, high risk investments are recommended over long time periods. If your investment falters, it has a longer time to recover. Taking risks at a younger age means you have more attempts to make things stick. This is doubly so with privilege! Acknowledge any privilege you might have, and use it to your advantage.

## Conclusion

Optimism isn't about ignoring problems - it's about believing they can be solved. The book Factfulness breaks down why the world is progressing faster than we think, and reinforced my view that optimism is the rational choice. I'd highly recommend it to anyone.
