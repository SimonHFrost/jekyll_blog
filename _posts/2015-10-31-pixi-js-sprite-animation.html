title: Pixi.js Sprite Animation

<p>When I work on projects I get distracted with writing boilerplate and simply getting things to work, that I often run out of energy or time when it comes to doing the interesting parts. That’s why for my next project I want to focus on smallest subsection possible, and polish it well.</p><p>The focus was on sprite animation, and elegantly swapping between animations when interacting with the environment. A co-worker recommended Pixi.js which looked great for doing sprite sheet based animations. This blog documents my progress implementing the final result which you can see here: <a href="http://www.simonhfrost.com/runner">http://www.simonhfrost.com/runner</a>.</p><p>After browsing the Pixi.js documentation I dove into a basic sprite sheet example found at <a href="http://pixijs.github.io/examples/index.html?s=basics&amp;f=spritesheet.js&amp;title=SpriteSheet%20Animation">http://pixijs.github.io/examples/index.html?s=basics&amp;f=spritesheet.js&amp;title=SpriteSheet%20Animation</a>. I wanted to use my own sprites so found this great one from the game Braid:</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/520/0*v-9KSDYtRcYIoCHv.png" /></figure><p>When working with sprite sheets you also need an accompanying configuration file that maps the individual sprites. I found a sprite mapping tool at <a href="http://www.leshylabs.com/apps/sstool/">http://www.leshylabs.com/apps/sstool/</a>, which had kick ass automatic parsing (but just needed a bit of tweaking).</p><p>The .json output was a bit different to what was required in Pixi.js. I wanted to investigate the .json in the Pixi.js example, but it wasn’t easily available. After a bit of investigation I found it on Github at: <a href="https://github.com/pixijs/examples/blob/gh-pages/examples/assets/spritesheet/fighter.json">https://github.com/pixijs/examples/blob/gh-pages/examples/assets/spritesheet/fighter.json</a>. The format was actually very similar, the main differences being that the co-ordinates were in different sections, and it also referenced the sprite sheet image within a meta element.</p><p>When re-mapping json, to minimize ones sanity I highly recommend using this JSON formatter: <a href="https://jsonformatter.curiousconcept.com/">https://jsonformatter.curiousconcept.com/</a></p><p>Working on this simple example was a great short introduction to Pixi.js but I was starting to feel that it doesn’t give you much control over the animations and user interaction. I found this blog post: <a href="http://www.html5gamedevs.com/topic/2393-creating-an-object-with-multiple-animations-in-pixijs/">http://www.html5gamedevs.com/topic/2393-creating-an-object-with-multiple-animations-in-pixijs/</a> which said:</p><blockquote><em>Pixi can certainly be used to create games, but it’s focus is more on being a kick-ass rendering engine — which it is. Having said that, you will find a lot of the “niceties” of some gaming engines just aren’t available in Pixi.js — that’s just not its job.</em></blockquote><p>I decided to cut this project short, and re-evaluate if Pixi.js is a good tool for creating a sufficient prototype. Another option would be to use <a href="http://phaser.io/">http://phaser.io/</a> which is more of a game engine and supports user interaction better. But for now I’ll leave <a href="http://simonhfrost.com/runner/">http://simonhfrost.com/runner/</a> to live out it’s legacy.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=1546867f64ae" width="1" height="1" alt="">
