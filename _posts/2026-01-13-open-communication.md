The ways humans comunnicated have exploded over the last decade. It's important to be explicit in how your organisation communicated, since it's the foundation for everything and defines your culture.

Communication is one of those things where you might not notice it's lacking, but you feel it every day through: not trusting your co-workers, delays in getting the information you need, or general frustration.

Communication isn't just one-to-one anymore

Open communication is the key
---

If you have important information in DMs or private channels, you lose what the internet has given us to improve workplace communication.

Taking the conversation public
---

If you need information from someone, don't DM them, mention them in a channel. This has many benefits like if you're asking the wrong person, the proper person can answer, other members can see context, it's categorised by channel name, and searchable in the future.

Managing channels
---

Every person should be able to create channels. Channels can take all forms, from long running broader topics, to short running specific ones. Channels should also be actively deleted when inactive to reduce bloat, and fee like an active community. It's also good to have a general channel for bigger announcements, as well as a random channel in case people can't decide what channel to use.

You should have a maximum number of channels so that conversations stay focused and on topic, but not too little that people are talking over each other.

When organisations get big
---

Communication can become fragmented when using multiple platforms. Fight to keep everyone together because it instantly created an 'us' vs. 'them' mindeset.

Should communication be 100% open?
---

I generally like to avoid absolute statements.
