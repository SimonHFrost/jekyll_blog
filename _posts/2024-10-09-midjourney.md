Generative AI use is transforming creative digital design workflows! In this post, I'll share the process I used to create consistently stylized New Zealand deserts with Midjourney, which you can apply throughout digital design from storyboarding, stock image generation, and icons.

## Step 1 - Determining a seed prompt

To ensure a consistent theme between images, you need consistent prompts. The easiest way to do this is… to get AI help you 😊. This is what I asked Claude:

Input:

<div class="code-block">
Prepare a midjourney prompt for an image of a pink New Zealand lamington, cartoon style modern, funky, and trippy. The aim is to come up with a style I can use with different reference images to convey a theme.
</div>

Output:

<div class="code-block">
Pink New Zealand lamington, cartoon-style illustration, vibrant neon colors, surreal distortions, geometric patterns, swirling psychedelic backgrounds, bold outlines, exaggerated proportions, abstract shapes, retro-futuristic elements, liquid textures, kaleidoscopic effects
</div>

This ended up being… a bit too bizarre for my preferences. With almost all of the prompt emphasizing surrealness. Feel free to test the prompt and adjust to your liking. The goal here is to be detailed enough that when you reuse the prompts the style will be consistent, so just don’t make it too short.

## Step 2 - Give AI a helping hand

I had a specific positioning in mind for my images and found that AI couldn’t read my mind after all. I’ve found from experience that generative AI isn’t best at reflecting positioning, and layout, and it’s usually better to supply a quick sketch.

Here’s what I had in mind for a pink cube lamington. I ended up leaving the lined paper in the sketch as it could add an interesting stylistic element to the end result.

It’s been possible to supply reference images through discord for a while, and with the new web interface it’s become even easier. Featuring the button right next to the search area

<div class="code-block">

</div>

## Step 3 - Iterate!

Midjourney will give you four resulting options.

I often find that Midjourney gets close… but not quite there. Once you have something similar to what you want, choose one of the four images that it gave you back and iterate! Clicking iterate in the bottom right hand ‘Creation Actions’ menu will give you four more images (hopefully closer to what’s in your third eye)

Use upscale when you’re happy with what you want, and want higher resolution

Also try experimenting with your prompt! Remove or add sections that don’t align with your vision. In my case, Midjourney got close with a lammington representation, but I didn't want any cream.

## Step 4 - No cream please!

<div class="code-block">

</div>

## Conclusion

Generative AI tools like midjourney lower the barrier to digital design by offloading some of the creative process to AI.
