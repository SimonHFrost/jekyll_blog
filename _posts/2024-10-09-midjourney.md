Generative AI is transforming creative digital design. Identifying and optimising workflows with existing AI tools are essential for staying ahead of the curve ðŸ“ˆ.

In this blog post, I'll share my workflow to create consistently stylised assets with Midjourney featuring my favorite New Zealand deserts. This workflow can be used throughout digital design from storyboarding, stock image generation, icons, and much, much, more... âœ¨

## 1) Develop a consistent style seed prompt

To ensure a consistent theme between images... you need consistent prompts. Crafting a prompt that's stylistically specific, yet general enough to represent your target items can be difficult if you don't have prompt engineering experience. That's where your favorite LLM (Claude, ChatGPT) can help!

Input:

<div class="code-block">
Prepare a midjourney prompt for an image of a pink New Zealand lamington, cartoon style modern, funky, and trippy. The aim is to come up with a style I can use with different reference images to convey a theme.
</div>

Prompt:

<div class="code-block">
Pink New Zealand lamington, cartoon-style illustration, vibrant neon colors, surreal distortions, geometric patterns, swirling psychedelic backgrounds, bold outlines, exaggerated proportions, abstract shapes, retro-futuristic elements, liquid textures, kaleidoscopic effects
</div>

## 2) Tweak your prompt

This ended up beingâ€¦ a bit too bizarre for me. A LLM should get you to a good stylistic starting point, but you'll have to adjust until you get something close to your target aesthetic.

For me this meant removing abstract references and adjusting some terminology:

<div class="code-block">
Cartoon-style illustration of a pink New Zealand lamington, vibrant color palette, playful geometric shapes, funky patterns, bold outlines, slightly exaggerated proportions, retro-inspired elements, smooth gradients, dynamic composition
</div>

## 3) Upload reference images

I find Midjourney isn't great with specifics. Although the technology is constantly improving, prompts like 'on the left side' or using specific colors can be a surprising challenge.

I had specific positioning in mind and found it was quicker to supply a quick sketch.

I included the lined paper as it would add an interesting stylistic element. Ultimately this is a creative workflow, which often requires creative solutions!

Since August 2024, Midjourney has become more accessible with it's new web interface <a href="midjourney.com">Midjourney.com</a>. One of the benefits is that it has become super easy to upload images with a promminent icon button right next to the search area.

## 4) No cream please!

Midjourney is fixated on giving me a Lammington with cream. Honing in to your perfect prompt

<div class="code-block">
Cartoon-style illustration of a pink New Zealand lamington, ... --no cream
</div>

## 5) Iterate!

The key to a good generated assets are the iterations along the way. I often find that Midjourney gets closeâ€¦ yet you might not know what is lacking. That's where variations come in!

![Vary](/assets/midjourney/vary.jpg)

Choose one of the four images that it gave you back and iterate! Clicking iterate in the bottom right hand â€˜Creation Actionsâ€™ menu will give you four more images (hopefully closer to whatâ€™s in your third eye)

Midjourney will give you four resulting options.

Use upscale when youâ€™re happy with what you want, and want higher resolution

Also try experimenting with your prompt! Remove or add sections that donâ€™t align with your vision. In my case, Midjourney got close with a lammington representation, but I didn't want any cream.

## Conclusion

Generative AI tools like midjourney lower the barrier to digital design by offloading some of the creative process to AI.
